# Object-Oriented assignment

Object-oriented (OO) programming and design is an entire semester course (or more). The goal of this
assignment is to give you an idea how to use basic OO features of python.

# Task 1: 1D array (10 points)

Task1 involved creating a 1D array object pattern after numpy's [ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html),
but much less efficient. Start by looking at task_1.py and filling in the implementation details. You
can see how your implementation is performing by running `pytest test_task_1.py` after installing
pytest.
